# README

This is a redo of the Flashcards project provided by Turing School of Software and Design. 
Instead of this project being in Ruby, it is being written in Java.
This project is a work in progress and its purpose is to help me learn Java.

## Addendum
JUnit testing has FINALLY been added to this repo, despite it being finished a few months ago. This is fine since I realized one of my methods in the ```Round``` class wasn't working properly so there's that.
